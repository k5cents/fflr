The fflr package is used to query the [ESPN Fantasy Football
API](https://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/) for both the current
and prior seasons. Get data on fantasy league members, teams, and
individual athletes.

This package was designed and tested for a standard 10-team league. Most
functions should for other leagues, but contributions are welcome.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fflr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/kiernann/fflr)::

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/fflr")
```

## Usage

starting at version 0.4.0, the bulk of this package has been removed and
is under active development from the ground up. Some functionality in
versions prior to 0.4.0 may still work, but much of the package was
developed and tested to only work during the 2020 NFL season and thus
has broken over time. Efforts are being made to develop future versions
of fflr to better adapt over time.
