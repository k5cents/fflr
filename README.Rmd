The `fflr` package is used to query the [ESPN Fantasy Football API](https://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/), (for current and past seasons) and format the results into [tidy data frames](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `fflr` from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/fflr")
```

## Usage

Here we see how we can chain together `fantasy_*()` and `form_*()` functions to plot the weekly scores of each team in a stacked bar chart.

```{r score_plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=9}
library(tidyverse)
library(fflr)

gaa <- extract_lid("https://fantasy.espn.com/football/league?leagueId=252353")
teams <- form_teams(data = fantasy_members(lid = gaa))
scores <- fantasy_matchup(lid = gaa) %>% 
  pluck("schedule") %>%
  map_df(form_matchup) %>% 
  right_join(teams) %>% 
  filter(score != 0)

scores %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(abbrev, score), y = score)) +
  labs(title = "Fantasy Football Scores", x = "Team", y = "Score") +
  geom_col(aes(fill = week)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 800, by = 50)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1, reverse = TRUE)) +
  coord_flip()
```
