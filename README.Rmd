The fflr package is used to query the [ESPN Fantasy Football API][api] for both
the current and prior seasons. Get data on fantasy league members, teams, and
individual athletes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `fflr` from [GitHub][fflr] with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/fflr")
```

## Usage

Here we see how to scrape teams, rosters, scores, and waiver pickups.

Use `set_lid()` to easily define your league ID (from the URL) in `options()`.

```{r team_roster}
library(fflr)
set_lid(252353) 
# https://fantasy.espn.com/football/team?leagueId=252353&teamId=6
# get last week's roster
rosters <- team_roster(week = ffl_week(-1))
(my_roster <- rosters[[5]][-5])
# compare vs optimal
my_best <- best_roster(my_roster)
roster_score(my_roster)
roster_score(my_best)
```

Matchups return as a [tidy](https://w.wiki/Jzz) tibble of weekly scores by team.

```{r league_teams}
library(tidyverse)
(teams <- league_teams()[, -3])
scores <- weekly_matchups()
```

This makes scores over the season easy to plot. The experimental [ffplot] 
package makes to easy to create those plots. 

```{r plot_scores, echo=FALSE}
library(ffplot)
weekly_scores(scores)
```

Some functions like `roster_moves()` only define players by their unique ID.

```{r waiver_adds}
waiver_adds <- 
  roster_moves() %>% 
  filter(
    type == "WAIVER", 
    status == "EXECUTED",
    move == "ADD"
  )
```

The included `players` tibble identifies all `r nrow(players)` players (as of
September 25th, 2020).

```{r join_player}
waiver_adds %>% 
  left_join(players) %>% 
  select(15:18, bid, team = to_team) %>%
  left_join(teams[, 1:2]) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bid))
```
