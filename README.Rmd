The fflr package is used to query the [ESPN Fantasy Football API][api]. Get data
on fantasy football league members, teams, and individual athletes.

This package has been tested with a narrow subset of possible league settings.
If a function doesn't work as intended, please file an [issue on GitHub][iss].

## Installation

You can install the development version of fflr from [GitHub][fflr]:

```{r install-github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/fflr")
```

## Usage

```{r library-fflr}
library(fflr)
packageVersion("fflr")
```

Data is only available for public leagues. See [this help page][help] on how to
make a private league public

Functions require a unique `leagueId`, which can be found in any ESPN page URL.

<pre>https://fantasy.espn.com/football/league?leagueId=<b>42654852</b></pre>

Use `ffl_id()` to set a default `fflr.leagueId` option. Your `.Rprofile` file 
can [set this option on startup][rprof].

```{r rm-opt, echo=FALSE}
options(fflr.leagueId = NULL)
```

```{r ffl-id, message=TRUE}
ffl_id(leagueId = "42654852")
```

The `leagueId` argument defaults to `ffl_id()` and can be omitted once set.

```{r league-teams}
league_info()
league_teams()
```

The `scoringPeriodId` argument can be used to get data from past weeks.

```{r team-roster}
team_roster(scoringPeriodId = 1)[[3]][, -c(1:3, 5, 13:15)]
```

There are included objects for NFL teams and players.

```{r nfl-players}
nfl_teams
```
