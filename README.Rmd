The fflr package is used to query the [ESPN Fantasy Football API][api] for both
the current and prior seasons. Get data on fantasy league members, teams, and
individual athletes.

This package was designed and tested for a standard 10-team league. Most
functions should for other leagues, but contributions are welcome.

## Installation

You can install the released version of fflr from [CRAN][cran]:

```{r install_cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("fflr")
```

The development version can be installed from [GitHub][fflr]:

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kiernann/fflr")
```

## Usage

```{r library}
library(fflr)
library(ffplot)
library(tidyverse)
```

Here we see how to scrape teams, rosters, scores, and waiver pickups, etc.

Most data can only be scraped from _public_ leagues. [This ESPN help
page][help] has instructions for making a league viewable.

For convenience, you can define a league ID as `lid` with `options()`.

<pre>
https://fantasy.espn.com/football/league?leagueId=<b>252353</b>
</pre>

```{r options}
options(lid = 252353)
getOption("lid")
```

Then data can be scraped and automatically formatted into data frames.

```{r team_roster}
rosters <- team_roster(week = ffl_week(-1))
my_roster <- rosters[[5]]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
(my_roster <- rosters[[5]][c(-1, -5)])
```

Some functions help calculate statistics like the optimal roster score.

```{r best_roster}
my_best <- best_roster(my_roster)
roster_score(my_roster)
roster_score(my_best)
```

Matchups return as a [tidy][tidy] tibble of weekly scores by team.

```{r league_teams}
(scores <- match_scores())
```

This makes scores over the season easy to plot, especially with the
**experimental** [ffplot] package.

```{r plot_scores, echo=FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("kiernann/ffplot")
ffplot::weekly_scores(scores)
```

Some functions like `roster_moves()` only define players by their unique ID.

```{r waiver_adds}
waiver_adds <- 
  roster_moves(week = 5) %>% 
  filter(
    type == "WAIVER", 
    status == "EXECUTED",
    move == "ADD"
  )
```

The included `nfl_players` tibble identifies all `r nrow(nfl_players)` players
(as of September 30th, 2020).

```{r nfl_players, echo=FALSE}
nfl_players
```

This can be joined against other data to identify players.

```{r join_player}
waiver_adds %>% 
  ffl_merge(nfl_players[, 1:3]) %>% 
  select(15:16, bid, team = to_team) %>%
  mutate(across(team, team_abbrev)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bid))
```
